    <p>paghetti aglio e olio (Italian for '"spaghetti [with] garlic and oil"') is a traditional Italian pasta dish from
        Naples. It is a typical dish of Neapolitan cuisine and is widely popular.</p>
    <p>Its popularity can be attributed to it being simple to prepare and the fact that it makes use of inexpensive,
        readily available ingredients that have long shelf lives in a pantry.</p>
    <p>This particular version adds muggine bottarga (cured mullet roe); an ancient traditional food from the island of
        Sardinia in Italy. </p>
    <h2 class="ingredientsBack">Ingrediends</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti </li>
        <li>Â¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, or more to taste </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>1 red chile pepper, seeded and minced </li>
        <li>2 ounces grated Sardinian mullet bottarga, divided </li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley </li>
        <li>1 small lemon, zested </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="stepsBack">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring
            occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add garlic to the oil and cook until just warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Add chile pepper and stir
            together, reducing the temperature to medium-low. Continue stirring. The garlic should never become dark
            brown or crispy. If this has happened, the garlic is burnt and no longer appropriate for consumption.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta, reserving at least 1 cup pasta water. Add the spaghetti to the oil mixture, still on
            medium-low heat. Stir or toss until all the spaghetti is well coated. Add 3/4 of the bottarga and stir to
            mix with the spaghetti, adding the reserved pasta water to hydrate as needed. There should be a little
            "sauce" when serving but not soupy</li>
        <li>Divide onto 4 plates and sprinkle with chopped parsley and lemon zest; squeeze lemon juice over and sprinkle
            remaining bottarga on top right before serving.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
